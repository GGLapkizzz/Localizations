About Altruistic Mode
&Close
What is the Altruistic Mode?
Enabling this feature will prioritize uploads. For every part you download, you will upload twice as much. This mode will guarantee your torrent maintains an upload to download ratio of 2:1 at all times as well as
keeping your torrent healthy. Keep in mind that this works best for popular torrents.

uTorrent lets you download the content you want, in just three simple steps.
To FIND what you're after, click here to browse through exciting content from our growing list of partners such as TEDTalks and Vodo Movies.
OR enter a search term to explore the world of torrents.
Be prepared.
You will leave uTorrent and your browser will open to unaffiliated Web sites.
Some sites will have many links -
remember you're looking for a link to a torrent download.
If you did the first step correctly, you will have downloaded a file that ends in (dot) torrent
Simply open the file,
and then return to uTorrent and click here to watch the action as uTorrent trades bits and pieces with others until you have a complete torrent file.
Finally, once your download is complete,
options such as PLAY will be selectable.
With uTorrent, downloading the content you want is made simple
